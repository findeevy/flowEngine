- C++ and OpenGL
- PBR
- Editor and Player Model
- Easy Mapping Tools

  gfx/ (generic graphics structs, etc)
    ogl/ (opengl specific code)
    vlk/ (vulkan specific code)

  scene/ (game engine scene objects/logic)
  net/ (networking...)
  utils/ (generic utils used across all parts of engine)
  core/ (front facing app logic, window interaction, etc)
